I've always been fond of reading be it a nail biting novel or an intensive computer science book. So here is a list of books I love ordered by categories(Not up to date in any way).

## Misc
1. [What every programmer should know about memory](futuretech.blinkenlights.nl/misc/cpumemory.pdf) by *U Drepper*: A long read but totally worth it especially if you like learning about very low level stuff.
2. [The Last Lecture](http://amzn.to/2zxho8M) by *Randy Pausch*. Changed my whole perspective about life, how fragile it is. Watch [Last Lecture: Achieving Your Childhood Dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo) on which the book is based.
3. [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://amzn.to/2zyTTMr) by *Gayle Laakmann McDowell*
4. [What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic](https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~dwharder/NumericalAnalysis/02Numerics/Double/paper.pdf): Just like the first one.

## Computer Science
1. Structure and Interpretation of programs: [Interactive online book](https://xuanji.appspot.com/isicp/), [Paperback](http://amzn.to/2zAj69c)
2. [Introduction to Statistical learning](http://amzn.to/2hqW0LG): Very light on math but quite useful to start with data science.

## Programming(Language agnostic)
1. [Clean Code](http://amzn.to/2hr5WoI) by *Robert C. Martin*: Hands down best book I've read about programming. Fun read with lots of examples. Mostly describes OOP practices.
2. [Coders at work](http://amzn.to/2zzk1qM) by *Peter Seibel*: Interviews with 15 highly accomplished programmers.
3. [The Art of UNIX Programming](http://amzn.to/2zyI8po) by *Eric S. Raymond*
4. [Code Complete 2](http://amzn.to/2zxwX0g): Havent read this yet but its definately on my reading list.
5. [Architecture of Open source Applications](https://github.com/aosabook/aosabook)

### JavaScript
1. [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) by *Kyle Simpson*: Best book on JavaScript as a language. Doesn't talk about different APIs, node.js, browser issues. Just pure Javascript.
2. [Eloquent JavaScript](http://amzn.to/2zAteNo) or [use the free online version](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)
3. [HTML5 Rocks](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/)
