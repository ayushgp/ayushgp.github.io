I've always been fond of reading be it a nail biting novel or an intensive computer science book. So here is a list of books I love ordered by categories.

## Misc
1. [What every programmer should know about memory](futuretech.blinkenlights.nl/misc/cpumemory.pdf) by *U Drepper*: A long read but totally worth it especially if you like learning about very low level stuff.
2. [The Last Lecture](http://amzn.to/2zxho8M) by *Randy Pausch*. Changed my whole perspective about life, how fragile it is. Watch [Last Lecture: Achieving Your Childhood Dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo) on which the book is based.
3. [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://amzn.to/2zyTTMr) by *Gayle Laakmann McDowell*
4. [What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic](https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~dwharder/NumericalAnalysis/02Numerics/Double/paper.pdf): Just like the first one.

## Computer Science
1. Structure and Interpretation of programs: [Interactive online book](https://xuanji.appspot.com/isicp/), [Paperback](http://amzn.to/2zAj69c)
2. [Operating System Concepts](http://amzn.to/2yq3P7Q): Great book, I also found [these notes](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/) quite helpful as they provide a nice summary.
3. [The Algorithm design manual](http://amzn.to/2yuk03J): Found it to be easier read than [CLRS](http://amzn.to/2hrg294). Also if you're looking for code samples of algorithms, check out [Algorithms by Sedgewick](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/).
4. [Introduction to Statistical learning](http://amzn.to/2hqW0LG): Very light on math but quite useful to start with data science.

## Programming(Language agnostic)
1. [Clean Code](http://amzn.to/2hr5WoI) by *Robert C. Martin*: Hands down best book I've read about programming. Fun read with lots of examples. Mostly describes OOP practices.
2. [Coders at work](http://amzn.to/2zzk1qM) by *Peter Seibel*: Interviews with 15 highly accomplished programmers.
3. [The Art of UNIX Programming](http://amzn.to/2zyI8po) by *Eric S. Raymond*
4. [Code Complete 2](http://amzn.to/2zxwX0g): Havent read this yet but its definately on my reading list.
5. [Architecture of Open source Applications](https://github.com/aosabook/aosabook)

### JavaScript
1. [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) by *Kyle Simpson*: Best book on JavaScript as a language. Doesn't talk about different APIs, node.js, browser issues. Just pure Javascript.
2. [JavaScript Patterns](http://amzn.to/2AzOyTl)
3. [HTML5 Rocks](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/)

## Fiction
1. [The Godfather](http://amzn.to/2yRJegJ) by *Mario Puzo*: Read this book thrice and I just love it.
2. [Angels and Demons](http://amzn.to/2ysb2UU) by *Dan Brown*
3. [The Kite Runner](http://amzn.to/2yQJwVc) by *Khaled Hosseini*
4. [A Thousand Splendid Suns](http://amzn.to/2i2MR9p) by *Khaled Hosseini*
5. [Life of Pi](http://amzn.to/2i41dGy) by *Yann Martel*
6. [Tuesdays with Morrie](http://amzn.to/2ypXARp) by *Mitch Albom*

## Non-fiction
1. [Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail](http://amzn.to/2zxxGi0)
2. [The Power of Habit](http://amzn.to/2AzM7js) by *Charles Duhigg*
3. [Freakonomics](http://amzn.to/2AB7d0Q) by *Stephen J. Dubner and Steven Levitt*
4. [Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind](http://amzn.to/2ypyYYN) by *Yuval Noah Harari*
